# Power-law adaptation in the presynaptic vesicle cycle

This code reproduces the results presented in "Power-law adaptation in the presynaptic vesicle cycle" by F. Mikulasch, S. Georgiev, L. Rudelt, S. Rizzoli & V. Priesemann.

## How to use

To reproduce the results most figures require to first run the Julia file (e.g., `B_run.jl`) and then the associated python file (`B_plot.py`). MCMC results in figure 3 require to first run the notebooks (e.g., `bayes-fit.ipynb`). For the results in figure 4 E and F the dataset `hc-11` has to be downloaded beforehand. See `fig4/h11_data/README.txt`
